# EVERYTHING ON THIS LIST WILL WORK IF YOU'RE SMART WITH IT AND DON'T GET CAUGHT OR OVERSHARE IT DON'T BE DUMB!!!
if you don't wanna see all of my jibber jabber please move on to the next section or just look for "method" but as far as i know your organization only has control of your google account not your computer!!! so there are so many easy ways to set up and work around your schools block from there wifi or things like spy-ware like goguardian, secerly, etc. (i forgot the rest). but you can do it with javascript on certain sties also you don't need the "inspect" for some but some you do. I would say the javascript methods (or bookmark) are limited to either your chromebook version or the way your organization sets it up. please acknowledge that in no way shape or form should you use these for cheating but these will cause detremental affects to your school career (unless you're not going to college or just dgaf) i recommend using this for educational reasons only or if you want to test ways to figure out on how to patch or stop these methods from working in your school organization. okay so now i've cleared that bs i will continue to share these things until either i can't figure out a way to do these again (because at some point they can become way more advanced than a teen with 2 years of coding experience against people with way smarter brain than my and more exprience and plus they have teams i'm doing this all myself btw) or when i'm done with school (this can be passed on with someone else with an passion of coding a breaching on software) please if you take this from me do NOT try to promote it as your own atleast credit me "https://github.com/DeroXP/" or DeroVB :) and continue on with your whatever bs you're doing with this or these methods i have searched for other methods from "lgtbeef", "blast", and "ingot". and as i know from now those have been patched unless your school does not update your chromebooks past version v102 (you can figure this out by typing "chrome://version" in the omni bar or by typing it in the URL thing not the google search bar!) but if you see that it is search in github for "lgtbeef" should be a github respo unless it got deleted. anyway that is it for now bye.
